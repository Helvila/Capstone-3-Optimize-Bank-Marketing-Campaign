# Capstone-3-Optimize-Bank-Marketing-Campaign

## Still On Progress

## Business Problem
1. Context
Banks often use marketing campaigns to attract new customers to open term deposit accounts. These campaigns can be conducted through various channels such as telephone, email, or direct mail. The data provided comes from one such marketing campaign conducted by a bank, which includes information about the customers contacted, their personal details, and whether they subscribed to a term deposit. The main objective of these campaigns is to maximize the number of successful subscriptions to term deposits, which can contribute significantly to the bank's growth and profitability.

2. Problem Statement
Currently, the bank's marketing campaigns involve contacting all potential customers without any filtering, leading to inefficiencies in terms of time and cost. This approach results in many unsuccessful contacts, as a significant portion of the customers contacted do not end up subscribing to the term deposit. To optimize the process, the bank needs a more efficient method to identify and target customers who are most likely to subscribe. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can help the bank focus its efforts on the most promising prospects, thus improving the overall success rate of the campaigns.

3. Goal
To predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and contact information.

4. Analytic Approach
We will perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and identify patterns or trends. Following this, we will build a classification model to predict the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit. This model will be trained using the provided customer data, which includes features such as age, job, balance, housing loan status, and previous campaign outcomes.
