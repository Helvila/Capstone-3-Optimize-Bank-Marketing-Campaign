# Capstone-3-Optimize-Bank-Marketing-Campaign


## Business Problem
1. Context
Banks often use marketing campaigns to attract new customers to open term deposit accounts. These campaigns can be conducted through various channels such as telephone, email, or direct mail. The data provided comes from one such marketing campaign conducted by a bank, which includes information about the customers contacted, their personal details, and whether they subscribed to a term deposit. The main objective of these campaigns is to maximize the number of successful subscriptions to term deposits, which can contribute significantly to the bank's growth and profitability.

2. Problem Statement
Currently, the bank's marketing campaigns involve contacting all potential customers without any filtering, leading to inefficiencies in terms of time and cost. This approach results in many unsuccessful contacts, as a significant portion of the customers contacted do not end up subscribing to the term deposit. To optimize the process, the bank needs a more efficient method to identify and target customers who are most likely to subscribe. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can help the bank focus its efforts on the most promising prospects, thus improving the overall success rate of the campaigns.

3. Goal
To predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and contact information.

4. Analytic Approach
We will perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and identify patterns or trends. Following this, we will build a classification model to predict the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit. This model will be trained using the provided customer data, which includes features such as age, job, balance, housing loan status, and previous campaign outcomes.

5. Evaluation Matrix

We will use precision as our primary evaluation metric. The reason for focusing on precision is to minimize the number of false positives, which means reducing the number of customers who are predicted to subscribe but do not actually subscribe. This is particularly important because contacting these customers incurs costs and wastes resources, which we aim to minimize.

False Positive (FP): A customer predicted to subscribe, but who does not, leading to wasted effort and resources. Reducing false positives will help make the marketing campaign more cost-effective.
False Negative (FN): A potential customer predicted not to subscribe, but who actually does subscribe, resulting in a missed opportunity. While reducing false negatives is also important, our primary focus will be on reducing false positives to improve the efficiency of the campaign.
By optimizing for precision, we aim to ensure that our marketing efforts are focused on the most promising prospects, thereby improving the overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the bank's marketing campaigns.




The bank marketing campaign dataset has the following columns:

- age: Age of the client
- job: Job type
- balance: Account balance
- housing: Housing loan (yes/no)
- loan: Personal loan (yes/no)
- contact: Contact communication type
- month: Last contact month of the year
- campaign: Number of contacts performed during this campaign
- pdays: Number of days since the client was last contacted from a previous campaign
- poutcome: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign
- deposit: Has the client subscribed to a term deposit? (yes/no) [target variable]

Data Preprocessing
First, I'll add the necessary steps for data preprocessing:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Feature scaling
